# CIFAR-10 Classifier Comparison

This project trains and evaluates three deep learning models (Vision Transformer, Hybrid CNN-MLP, and ResNet18) on the CIFAR-10 dataset and provides a Gradio web app for inference.
ViT achieved highest accuracy.

## Project Structure
- 2 Pre-trained model weights (ViT and CNN-MLP).
- `training models`: Jupyter notebook for training and evaluation.
- `src/main.py`: Gradio app for inference.
